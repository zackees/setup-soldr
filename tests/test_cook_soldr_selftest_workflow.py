"""Guards for the soldr cook self-test workflow.

The workflow's whole value is that it passes NO cook inputs: it exercises the
shipped defaults against a real workspace. A well-meaning edit that pins
`prebuild-deps: soldr-cook` there would keep the workflow green while
destroying what it tests, so that absence is asserted here rather than left to
review.
