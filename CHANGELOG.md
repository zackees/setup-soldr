# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Seed soldr's pinned zccache install during setup so isolated `SOLDR_CACHE_DIR`
  test roots do not refetch zccache or fall back to `cargo install`.
- Run that seed even when `build-cache` is disabled, and add
  `zccache-seed-strict` so repos can fail setup if zccache cannot be pinned
  instead of allowing a later slow `cargo install` fallback.
- Default `cache-payload-max-bytes` to `2GiB` with `skip` behavior to avoid
  uploading runaway multi-GiB zccache artifact caches in normal CI.

## v0.9.10 - 2026-05-26

- Fixed cache-mode benchmark methodology so the matrix now measures distinct
  build-affecting layers instead of reusing warmed target or zccache state.
- Added runner-image delta measurement for the solo-toolchain benchmark path.
- Verified the repaired default benchmark run:
